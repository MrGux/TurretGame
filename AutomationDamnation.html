		Introduction
		<br />
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight:600;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Automation Damnation</i> is a new take on the classic PvP
		card game playable with up to four players but works best with two. <i>Automation Damnation</i> is designed to
		speed up the rate of play of a typical card game by forcing players to play strictly on the offensive. By
		eliminating the typical attack/defense structure, <i>Automation Damnation</i> takes players out of their comfort
		zones to force them into coming up with creative combos instead of relying on predictable patterns that have
		become common place in modern card games.

		Order of Play
		<br />
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight:600;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turns in <i>Automation Damnation</i>
		happen over 3 phases. The first is the play phase. One at a time players take a turn deploying any turret cards 
		they would like to play from their hands.
			<br /><br />
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the play phase is the building
		phase. During this phase all turrets gain a build
		level.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The building phase is proceeded by the attack
		phase. In the attack phase, all fully built and loaded turrets automatically fire.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:2em; font-weight:700; width:3em; margin-left:26.5em;">
		<a id="CardTypes"></a>
		Card Types
		<br />
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight:600;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Automation Damnation</i> there are
		three card types: <i>Automoton</i> cards, <i>Turret</i> cards, and <i>Engineer</i>
		cards.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Automation Damnation</i> players each
		have their own <i>Automoton</i>. A player's <i>Automoton</i> is a representation of themselves and are
		automatically played in a stack at the start of the game, removing the top card when a stage is
		defeated.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turret and Engineer cards are held in the
		players hand. Each player intitially draws 5 cards to start the game and 1 more at the start of each of their
		turns.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turret cards are the units of <i>Automation
			Damnation</i>. They come in 4 varieties and each have unique properties. All turrets have a building level
		requirement, varying by the power level of the turret. This building level requirement is a value from 1 to 3.
		For each level of building required, a turret is turned 45 degrees counter clockwise. Whenever a turret gains a
		build level the turret card is turned 45 degrees clockwise until it is upright. Once upright a turret is fully
		built, but still must load, forcing it to skip the next attack phase.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final card type is the engineer card.
		Engineer cards are used by players during the building phase in the same order as the play phase of that turn.
		Engineer cards effect the game in a variety of ways in relation to build level and damage output of turrets, as
		well as interacting with other engineer cards. Each player can only play a maximum of 1 engineer card per build
		phase.</p>
	<p style="font-size:2em; font-weight:700; width:3em; margin-left:26.5em;">
		<a id="AutomotonCards"></a>
		Automoton Cards
		<br />
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight:600;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each players <i>Automoton</i> initially
		has 7 defense, meaning if an opposing player manages to deal 5 or more damage to the <i>Automoton</i>, it is
		damaged. Each <i>Automoton</i> can only take damage 3 times before being destroyed. Each player has 3
		<i>Automoton</i> cards, each representing a new stage, after taking damage a player's <i>Automoton</i> enters a
		new stage, going from <i>Strong</i> to <i>Damaged</i> to <i>Critical</i> and then is finally destroyed. The
		stages of the Automoton have different durability values as well, starting with 7 for the <i>Strong</i> stage, 10
		for the <i>Damaged</i> stage, and 15 for the <i>Critical</i> stage.</p>
	<p style="font-size:2em; font-weight:700; width:3em; margin-left:26.5em;"><a id="TurretCards"></a>
		Turret Cards
		<br />
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight:600;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turret cards exist in 4
		varieties.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first of turret card is the
		<i>Basic</i>. This turret requires 1 building level, does 1 damage, and has 1 durability.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second turret is the <i>Double Shot</i>.
		This turret requires 1 building level and does 2 damage but must load again after each round that it fires. This
		effectively means the turret fires once every other turn. This turret has 2 durability.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third turret is the <i>Burst</i>. This
		turret requires 2 building levels but does 3 damage when it fires! Like the <i>Double Shot</i>, the <i>Burst</i>
		must load after every shot. This turret has 3 durability.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The final turret is the
		<i>Flame Turret</i>. This turret requires 3 building level and deals 2 damage but must be loaded. However,
		unlike other turrets, this turret does not deal its damage to only one target, and instead deals its damage to
		all turrets and the <i>Automoton</i> of the player being targeted. This turret has 2 durabilty.
	</p>
	<p style="font-size:2em; font-weight:700; width:3em; margin-left:26.5em;">
		<a id="EngineerCards"></a>
		Engineer Cards
		<br />
	</p>
	<p style="font-weight:600;">
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Engineer cards also exist in 4
		varieties.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first engineer card is the
		<i>Barricade</i> card. This engineer card allows a player to build a 5 durability wall in front of their turrets.
		This wall lasts for 1 turn only and is used when an attack is anticipated to protect your turrets and
		<i>Automoton</i> from taking damage.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second card
		is the <i>Builder Strike</i> card. This card allows players to stop building of turrets for all players
		including themselves. Players may use this to delay opponents and draw more cards for a
		combo.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The third engineer card is the
		<i>Overdrive!</i> card. This card doubles to damage output of all of your turrets. Players use this card to deal
		maximum damage to destroy enemy turrets or break through the stages of <i>Automoton</i>
		defenses.
		<br /><br />
		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>Counter</i> is the 4th and final
		engineer card. This card nullifies the effects of all engineer cards for 1 turn. <i>Counter</i> is the only
		engineer card that can be played out of turn during the building phase, meaning you can wait until your opponent
		plays their own engineer card to use it, but still cannot be played if the player has already played an engineer
		card that turn.</p>
		<p style="font-size:2em; font-weight:700; width:3em; margin-left:26.5em;"><a id="Rules"></a>
			Rules
			<br />
		</p>
		<p style="font-weight:600;">
			<i>Turn Order</i>: Players may decide who goes first via coin toss, rock-paper-scissors, or any other method of 
			their choosing, the winner getting to decide who goes first. After this first turn, the player to go first during 
			the play phase moves over once clockwise, much like blinds in <i>Texas Hold'em</i>.
			<br /><br />
			<i>Durability</i>: Durability is 
			<br /><br />
			<i>Targeting Players</i>: Players dictate which player their turrets attack at the start of the phase by playing a 
			player token face down. All players then reveal their tokens and attacking commences.
			<br /><br />
			<i>Targeting Units</i>: Once a player has decided which opponent to attack, they decide whether their attacks 
			hit the players turrets or their <i>Automoton</i>. When a player chooses to attack turrets their attacks hit turrets 
			from the target player's left to right. All leftover damage is wasted and does not overflow to the player's 
			<i>Automoton</i>.
