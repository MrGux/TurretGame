                <i>Automation Damnation</i> is a new take on the classic PvP
		card game playable with up to four players but works best with two. <i>Automation Damnation</i> is designed to
		speed up the rate of play of a typical card game by forcing players to play strictly on the offensive. By
		eliminating the typical attack/defense structure, <i>Automation Damnation</i> takes players out of their comfort
		zones to force them into coming up with creative combos instead of relying on predictable patterns that have
		become common place in modern card games.

            </div>
            <div class="spear">
				Turns in <i>Automation Damnation</i>
				happen over 3 phases. The first is the play phase. One at a time players take a turn deploying any turret cards 
				they would like to play from their hands.
					<br /><br />
				After the play phase is the building
				phase. During this phase all turrets gain a build
				level.
				<br /><br />
				The building phase is proceeded by the attack
				phase. In the attack phase, all fully built and loaded turrets automatically fire.

                Card Types
                <br /><br />
            </div>
            <div class="hatchet">
				In <i>Automation Damnation</i> there are
				three card types: <i>Automaton</i> cards, <i>Turret</i> cards, and <i>Engineer</i>
				cards.
				<br /><br />
				In <i>Automation Damnation</i> players each
				have their own <i>Automaton</i>. A player's <i>Automaton</i> is a representation of themselves and are
				automatically played in a stack at the start of the game, removing the top card when a stage is
				defeated.
				<br /><br />
				Turret and Engineer cards are held in the
				players hand. Each player intitially draws 5 cards to start the game and 1 more at the start of each of their
				turns.
				<br /><br />
				Turret cards are the units of <i>Automation
					Damnation</i>. They come in 4 varieties and each have unique properties. All turrets have a building level
				requirement, varying by the power level of the turret. This building level requirement is a value from 1 to 3.
				For each level of building required, a turret is turned 45 degrees EMP clockwise. Whenever a turret gains a
				build level the turret card is turned 45 degrees clockwise until it is upright. Once upright a turret is fully
				built, but still must load, forcing it to skip the next attack phase.
				<br /><br />
				The final card type is the engineer card.
				Engineer cards are used by players during the building phase in the same order as the play phase of that turn.
				Engineer cards effect the game in a variety of ways in relation to build level and damage output of turrets, as
				well as interacting with other engineer cards. Each player can only play a maximum of 1 engineer card per build
				phase.</p>

				Each players <i>Automaton</i> initially
				has 7 defense, meaning if an opposing player manages to deal 5 or more damage to the <i>Automaton</i>, it is
				damaged. Each <i>Automaton</i> can only take damage 3 times before being destroyed. Each player has 3
				<i>Automaton</i> cards, each representing a new stage, after taking damage a player's <i>Automaton</i> enters a
				new stage, going from <i>Strong</i> to <i>Damaged</i> to <i>Critical</i> and then is finally destroyed. The
				stages of the Automaton have different durability values as well, starting with 7 for the <i>Strong</i> stage, 10
				for the <i>Damaged</i> stage, and 15 for the <i>Critical</i> stage.</p>

            <div class="containerone">
				Turret cards exist in 4
				varieties.
				<br /><br />
				The first of turret card is the
				<i>Basic</i>. This turret requires 1 building level, does 1 damage, and has 3 durability.
				<br /><br />
				The second turret is the <i>Double Shot</i>.
				This turret requires 1 building level and does 2 damage but must load again after each round that it fires. This
				effectively means the turret fires once every other turn. This turret has 2 durability.
				<br /><br />
				The third turret is the <i>Burst</i>. This
				turret requires 2 building levels but does 3 damage when it fires! Like the <i>Double Shot</i>, the <i>Burst</i>
				must load after every shot. This turret has 2 durability.
				<br /><br />
				The final turret is the
				<i>Flame Turret</i>. This turret requires 3 building level and deals 2 damage but must be loaded. However,
				unlike other turrets, this turret does not deal its damage to only one target, and instead deals its damage to
				all turrets and the <i>Automaton</i> of the player being targeted. This turret has 1 durabilty.

                Engineer Cards
                <br /><br />
            </div>
            <div class="parasix">
				Engineer cards also exist in 4
				varieties.
				<br /><br />
				The first engineer card is the
				<i>Barricade</i> card. This engineer card allows a player to build a 5 durability wall in front of their turrets.
				This wall lasts for 1 turn only and is used when an attack is anticipated to protect your turrets and
				<i>Automaton</i> from taking damage.
				<br /><br />
				The second card
				is the <i>Builder Strike</i> card. This card allows players to stop building of turrets for all players
				including themselves. Players may use this to delay opponents and draw more cards for a
				combo.
				<br /><br />
				The third engineer card is the
				<i>Overdrive!</i> card. This card doubles to damage output of all of your turrets. Players use this card to deal
				maximum damage to destroy enemy turrets or break through the stages of <i>Automaton</i>
				defenses.
				<br /><br />
				<i>EMP</i> is the 4th and final
				engineer card. This card nullifies the effects of all engineer cards for 1 turn. <i>EMP</i> is the only
				engineer card that can be played out of turn during the building phase, meaning you can wait until your opponent
				plays their own engineer card to use it, but still cannot be played if the player has already played an engineer
				card that turn.

                Rules
                <br /><br />
            </div>
            <div class="paraseven">
				<i>Turn Order</i>: Players may decide who goes first via coin toss, rock-paper-scissors, or any other method of 
				their choosing, the winner getting to decide who goes first. After this first turn, the player to go first during 
				the play phase moves over once clockwise, much like blinds in <i>Texas Hold'em</i>.
				<br /><br />
				<i>Durability</i>: Durability is the amount of damage a unit or <i>Automaton</i> stage can take before dying or moving to the next stage. Durability is completely restored at the start of the building phase of play.
				<br /><br />
				<i>Targeting Players</i>: Players dictate which player their turrets attack at the start of the phase by playing a 
				player token face down. All players then reveal their tokens and attacking commences.
				<br /><br />
				<i>Targeting Units</i>: Once a player has decided which opponent to attack, they decide whether their attacks 
				hit the players turrets or their <i>Automaton</i>. When a player chooses to attack turrets their attacks hit turrets 
				from the target player's left to right. All leftover damage is wasted and does not overflow to the player's 
				<i>Automaton</i>.
				<br /><br />
				<i>Card Counts</i>: Each player receives a set number of each card as follows-
				<br />
				Basic: 3 | Double Shot: 2 | Burst: 1 | Flame Turret: 1 |
				<br />
				Barricade: 3 | Builder Strike: 1 | Overdrive: 2 | EMP: 1 |
